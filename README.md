### Description

Many people are trying to understand how XML work. This app show one of the applications you can give to XML. This is a simple note creator that will convert user-inputs into an XML document and with the style sheet included you will be able to save this document and display it in a browser (only tested on IE 5.x but should work on Netscape 4.6+). All the code is fully documented. Don't forget to unzip the .css file (the style sheet) in the same directory. Please rate it by your appreciation so I can continue create innovative applications.

Note: You can easily modify the style sheet.
 
### More Info
 
Not tested under Netscape.
